# Bearing Capacity Estimation - In Progress
This project is about devising a methodology for prediction of the bearing capacity of shallow foundations by using machine learning algorithms on more than 100 loading test data. Iâ€™m using a range of algorithms (e.g. SVM, Random Forest) for my analysis. I try to publish the results of this study in a paper.
