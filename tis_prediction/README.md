# Tunneling Impacs on Springs (TIS)
First, in this study, a comprehensive database which contained information on 225 springs located in the vicinity of tunneling projects in Iran was developed. Due to lack of sufficient geological, hydrogeological and monitoring data, only 111 springs were chosen for further study. By analyzing the DHI method on this database, all aspects of impacts of tunneling on spring drawdown was studied. By learning from developed methods’ shortcomings, a new index was proposed. This new empirical classification system, named TIS (Tunneling Impacts on Spring), is based on statistical analysis of the developed database using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).

After this initial study which its result is published in a paper, I took it upon myself to use a more modern method for analyzing this database. I have used various algorithms for predicting the impact of tunneling on springs drawdown and Random Forest was the most successful one in my analysis. Then, I’ve decided to go further and to developed a website for deploying my ML model for general use. This website is hosted on Pythonanywhere.com and is currently under development.
